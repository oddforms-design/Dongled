# Contributing to Dongled
Hello! I'm Charles (oddforms) and I would like to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## My Goals for Open Sourcing this Project as of April 2024
- Code review & Improve the App: I am a self-taught coder, I would imagine there will be some things that should be adjusted to be 'best-practice' in terms of code layout that will be easy adjustments.
- Learning how to maintain a github project
- Allow others to contribute new features & fix bugs
- Share the project: The core UVC monitoring functions of the app maybe could be a useful starting point for other developers who want to do projects that involve a UVC monitor.

## Design Considerations for New Features
Dongled is designed as a plug-and-play experience, the dream is to avoid an interface at all. If you have a feature that you think would really be great that is going to require a button – go for it, but all I ask is to consider the best way to avoid deep menu systems and configuration pages.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make a detailed and clear commit message that explains what you did and why.
3. If you've added incomplete code or code that needs furthing testing, make sure thats clear!
4. Comment your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
5. If you would like, further explain or paste your commit in the discussion area.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/oddforms-design/Dongled/issues)
I am using GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## No Guarantee of Life
Dongled is a free, non-revenue generating app which costs actual money to keep running via App Store fees and the web domain, not to mention my time. Please be aware I reserve the right to stop distributing it on the AppStore and close down the project at any time. It's also possible that I will allow donations on the project in the future to cover these fees. I do not currently have the ability to promise any contributors any amount of this non-existant funding. Until otherwise notified, please consider your work freely contributed.
