# Contributing to Dongled
Hello! I'm Charles (oddforms) and I would like to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/oddforms-design/Dongled/issues)
I am using GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/oddforms-design/Dongled/issues).

## Join the discussion on Github's... discussions!
Want to talk about an issue or feature or something else? Head to the [discussions](https://github.com/oddforms-design/Dongled/discussions) page.

## My Goals for Open Sourcing this Project
- Allow others to contribute new features & fix bugs
- Share the project: The core UVC monitoring functions of the app could be a useful starting point for other developers.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make a detailed and clear commit message that explains what you did and why.
3. If you've added incomplete code or code that needs furthing testing, make sure thats clear!
4. Comment your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
5. If you would like, further explain or paste your commit in the discussion area prior to pulling.
6. Issue a pull request.

## No Guarantee of Life
Dongled is a free, non-revenue generating app which costs actual money to keep running via App Store fees and the web domain, not to mention my time. Please be aware I reserve the right to stop distributing it on the AppStore and close down the project git at any time. I accept donations via github donate toward the project but still pay out-of-pocket to keep the app online. Unless otherwise notified, please also consider your work freely contributed.
